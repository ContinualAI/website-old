Nowadays, more and more companies begin to embrace the power of Machine Learning in different business processes. Generally, the typical pipeline applied by companies consists of gathering data, learning some underlying structure, and deploying an algorithm that systematically captures what you have learned. Usually, gathering, preparing, and enriching the right training data is a key bottleneck among companies wanting to use machine learning. Therefore, relying on continuous learning as opposed to algorithms that are trained offline is a beneficial opportunity for companies.

In this section we provide a list of companies that exploit Continuous Learning approaches:

- [Neurala][neurala] uses deep learning neural network software that makes smart products (drones) more autonomous and useful. In particular, Neurala Lifelong Deep Neural Networks (Lifelong-DNN™) enable incremental learning of new objects on the fly, without the power of a server located in the cloud. Neurala accomplishes this by combining different neural network architectures (more info at [https://www.neurala.com/press-releases/edge-deep-learning-without-cloud][neurala-lifelong]).

-  [Amazon-Comprehend][Amazon-Comprehend] analyzes text and tells you what it finds, starting with the language, from Afrikaans to Yoruba, with 98 more in between. It can identify different types of entities (people, places, brands, products, and so forth), key phrases, sentiment (positive, negative, mixed, or neutral), and extract key phrases, all from text in English or Spanish. Finally, Comprehend‘s topic modeling service extracts topics from large sets of documents for analysis or topic-based grouping
