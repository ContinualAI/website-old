The *ContinualAI Reading Group* is hosted every Friday in collaboration with [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) and it is based on roughly 60 minutes discussion about a particular Continual Learning paper. Occasionally, a speaker is invited to explain his work. Join our reading group [on slack](https://join.slack.com/t/continualai/shared_invite/enQtNjQxNDYwMzkxNzk0LTBhYjg2MjM0YTM2OWRkNDYzOGE0ZTIzNDQ0ZGMzNDE3ZGUxNTZmNmM1YzJiYzgwMTkyZDQxYTlkMTI3NzZkNjU)! It will be the occasion to talk with other researchers of this amazing field!
